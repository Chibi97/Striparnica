      <p>My name is <strong class='warning'>Olja Ivkovic</strong> and I'm a sophomore student of <strong class='warning'>ICT College of Vocational Studies (IT module -> 34/16).</strong> Since I was little I was attracted to graphic design. As I grew older and older, I started getting interested in design for web, and since getting into ICT College, my passion for programming started developing. My aim for now is to become front-end developer (and oh, one of the best ones!) since that field connects web desgin & programming, but we'll see about that.
      The reason I chose this topic is simply because I like to read comics (especially Japanese ones - called Manga) in my free time.</p>
